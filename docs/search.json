My research interests are at the intersection of computing education research and human computer interaction (HCI). My research primarily focuses on broadening participation in computing, especially of non-CS majors and individuals with disabilities. I am also interested in computing education policy.\nIf you would also like to learn about my brilliant colleagues’ work, please visit TRAILS Lab!\nThanks!"
