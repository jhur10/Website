Thank you for visiting my website!

My name is Jinyoung Hur (but you can also call me Jina), and I am a Ph.D. student at the Computer Science Department at the Universtiy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research interests are at the intersection of **computing education research** and **human computer interaction** (HCI). My research primarily focuses on **broadening participation in computing**, especially of **non-CS majors** and **individuals with disabilities**. I am also interested in **computing education policy**.

If you would also like to learn about my brilliant colleagues' work, please visit [TRAILS Lab](https://trailslab.web.illinois.edu/)!

Thanks!
