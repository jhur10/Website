Thank you for visiting my website!

My name is Jinyoung Hur (you can also call me Jina), and I am a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie at the intersection of **computer science education** and **human-computer interaction** (HCI), with a long-term goal of **broadening participation** and **promoting inclusion in computing**. My current research focuses on: (1) understanding factors associated with motivation and persistence among historically underrepresented groups in CS; and (2) designing and evluating interventions and technologies for **non-CS majors** and **individuals with disabilities**. I am also interested in **computing education policy**.
